Atomic Repos were inspired by the [Atomic Essay](https://www.ship30for30.com/post/how-to-write-an-atomic-essay-a-beginners-guide) 
concept developed by [Dickie Bush](https://bio.link/dickiebush) and 
[Nicholas Cole](https://twitter.com/nicolascole77) as part of [
Ship 30 for 30](https://www.ship30for30.com/), what I consider the best available training 
and community dedicated to the game of Digital Writing.

Atomic Essays are approximately 250-word essays that explain a single idea and are 
published as visual screenshot, normally to Twitter. After participating in three Ship 30 
for 30 cohorts, I realized that a lot of things that I want to write don't really lend 
themselves to the Atomic Essay format. But they could still benefit from the other principles and practices of online writing.

## Enter Atomic Repos!

An Atomic Repo links an Atomic Essay illustrating an "atomic" coding concept in a single 
programming language with a GitHub repository containing code, tests, and continuous 
integration via GitHub Actions.

Great candidates for Atomic Repos include:

- Programming Exercises
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) Problems
- Code Katas
- Programming Cookbook-style Recipes
- ...
- Really anything that you can describe in 250-300 words!

## How Do They Work?

The Atomic Repos site is a static site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Hugo
can ingest content from external sources using [Hugo Modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/), which under the hood
leverage [Go Modules](https://go.dev/doc/modules/developing).

Each Atomic Repo is a Hugo Module that lives in its own GitHub repository. It contains a 
single page of Hugo `content`, which encapsulates the Atomic Essay portion
(e.g. `/content/repos/hello-world-java.md`), and a code project nested within 
the `static` directory (e.g. `/static/hello-world-java`). The intention is that 
you should be able to import this project to your IDE/editor or use command-line tools 
as you would for any normal project of that type.

## How Do I Contribute?

It's still early days for Atomic Repos, and I'm still working out a lot of kinks.
When things stabilize (hopefully, after the March 2022 Ship 30 for 30 cohort),
I'll be creating documentation for the contributor workflow. Stay tuned to our
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/AtomicRepos) for the latest updates!
